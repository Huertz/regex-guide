## Regex Components

### Anchors

### Quantifiers

Regular expressions use quantifiers to generate unbounded matching possibilities and other matching amount specifications. An atom can optionally be followed by one of these quantifiers:
 *   representing 0 or more occurrences of the atom,
 +   representing 1 or more occurrence of the atom,
 ?   representing 0 or 1 occurrences of the atom,
the bound {n}   representing exactly n occurrences of the atom,
the bound {m,n}   representing between m and n occurrences of the atom.
The quantifier can optionally be followed by "?" indicating that the match be minimal (non-greedy, reluctant) as opposed to the default maximal (greedy) match.
